### API Integration Code

Here's how the application integrates with Upstage Information Extractor:

```typescript
// services/ocr-service.ts
export async function extractBusinessCardData(imageFile: File, apiKey: string): Promise<BusinessCardData> {
  // Convert image to base64 data URL
  const imageDataURL = await fileToDataURL(imageFile);

  // Prepare the request payload
  const payload = {
    model: "information-extract",
    messages: [
      {
        role: "user",
        content: [
          {
            type: "image_url",
            image_url: {
              url: imageDataURL
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
    response_format: BUSINESS_CARD_SCHEMA,
    chunking: {
      pages_per_chunk: 1
    }
  };

  // Make API request to Upstage
  const response = await fetch("https://api.upstage.ai/v1/information-extraction", {
    method: "POST",
    headers: {
      "Authorization": `Bearer ${apiKey}`,
      "Content-Type": "application/json; charset=utf-8"
    },
    body: JSON.stringify(payload)
  });

  const result = await response.json();
  const extractedData = JSON.parse(result.choices[0].message.content);
  
  // Process and clean the extracted data
  return processExtractedData(extractedData);
}
```

### Data Processing and Validation

The application includes smart data processing to handle edge cases:

```typescript
// Smart field extraction with fallbacks
const name = extractedData.name || buildFullName(extractedData.first_name, extractedData.last_name);
const address = extractedData.address || buildAddress([
  extractedData.street_address,
  extractedData.city, 
  extractedData.state,
  extractedData.zip_code,
  extractedData.country
]);

// Separate mobile from main phone to avoid duplicates
const phone = extractedData.phone || extractedData.mobile;
const mobile = extractedData.mobile && extractedData.mobile !== phone ? extractedData.mobile : null;
```

## Quick Start

### 1. Get Your Upstage API Key

1. Visit [Upstage Console](https://console.upstage.ai/)

## How It Works

### 1. **Image Upload & Processing**
- Users upload business card images via drag-and-drop, file selection, or clipboard paste
- Images are converted to base64 format and resized for optimal processing
- Thumbnails are generated for efficient list display

### 2. **Upstage Information Extractor**
- Base64 image is sent to Upstage API with the business card schema
- Advanced AI model analyzes the image and extracts structured data
- Returns JSON response with identified fields and values

### 3. **Smart Data Processing**
- Application processes the raw extracted data
- Handles edge cases like missing names, duplicate phone numbers
- Builds complete addresses from components
- Validates and cleans all extracted fields

### 4. **User Experience**
- Extracted data appears in an editable form with auto-save
- Users can review and correct any fields
- Duplicate detection prevents saving identical cards
- Real-time search and filtering of saved cards

## Environment Configuration

The application uses environment variables for secure configuration:

- **Development**: Uses `.env.local` for local development
- **Production**: Set environment variables in your deployment platform
- **Security**: API keys are validated and never exposed to client-side code

```typescript
// lib/config.ts
export function getUpstageApiKey(): string {
  const apiKey = process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_UPSTAGE_API_KEY;
  
  if (!apiKey || apiKey === "your_upstage_api_key_here") {
    throw new Error("Upstage API key not configured");
  }
  
  return apiKey;
}
```

## Production Deployment

- Multiple images are pasted from clipboard
- Camera is used to take multiple photos (stays open after first capture)
- You click "Add More" on a single card preview

### üì± **Single vs Batch Behavior**

**Single Mode (Default):**
- Upload one image ‚Üí immediately shows preview and processes
- Take one photo ‚Üí camera closes, processes immediately
- Perfect for quick single card processing

**Batch Mode (Auto-activated):**
- Upload multiple images ‚Üí all go to queue
- Take photo ‚Üí camera stays open for more captures
- Shows queue with all pending cards
- Process all at once with one click

### üéØ **Usage Scenarios**

**Quick Single Card:**
1. Drop one image or take one photo
2. Review and edit the extracted data
3. Save to your collection

**Multiple Cards:**
1. Drop multiple images at once (auto-batch mode)
2. Or take first photo, then keep taking more (camera stays open)
3. Or upload one card and click "Add More" 
4. Review queue of all cards
5. Click "Process All" to extract data from all cards
6. Cards are automatically saved with duplicate detection

### ‚≠ê **Smart Features**

- **Camera Intelligence**: Automatically keeps camera open when it detects you want multiple captures
- **Flexible Addition**: Start with single mode, easily add more cards later
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indicators show when you're in batch mode
- **Error Resilience**: Individual card failures don't stop batch processing
- **Memory Efficient**: Processes cards sequentially to handle large batches

## Technical Implementation

### Batch Processing Flow
1. **Queue Management**: Files are added to a local queue with preview generation
2. **Parallel Processing**: Each file is processed sequentially with progress tracking
3. **Duplicate Detection**: Each extracted card is checked against existing cards
4. **Auto-Save**: Valid cards are automatically saved to user's collection
5. **Error Handling**: Failed extractions are logged and reported to user

### UX Design Principles
- **Non-blocking**: Users can continue adding files while processing
- **Visual Feedback**: Clear progress indicators and status updates
- **Error Recovery**: Individual file failures don't stop batch processing
- **Mobile-First**: Optimized camera workflow for mobile users
